# Proactive Customer Retention with Machine Learning

This project presents a data-driven approach to predicting customer churn for a financial institution. By analyzing customer demographics and banking behavior, this project builds and evaluates machine learning models to identify customers at risk of closing their accounts. The primary goal is to provide the bank with actionable insights to improve customer retention.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Plotly
- Matplotlib

## Model Performance

Both models performed well, with Gradient Boosting achieving a slightly higher accuracy.

| Model | Accuracy | 
| :--- | :---: | 
| Random Forest | 85.88% |
| **Gradient Boosting** | **86.16%** |

The Gradient Boosting model was selected as the final model due to its superior overall accuracy and precision in identifying customers who are likely to churn.
